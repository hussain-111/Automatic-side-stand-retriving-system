That sounds like a well-thought-out design! Using signals from the vehicle's speedometer to detect when the vehicle is moving and reaching a certain speed is a clever approach to trigger the side stand retrieval process. Incorporating feedback mechanisms to ensure that the side stand is only retracted when the vehicle is in motion and in the correct position adds an extra layer of safety.

Here's a breakdown of the process as I understand it:

1. **Signal Detection**: The microprocessor receives signals from both the vehicle and the speedometer.
2. **Speed Threshold Detection**: When the vehicle reaches a certain speed threshold, as indicated by the speedometer signal, the microprocessor initiates the process to retract the side stand.
3. **Position Monitoring**: The microprocessor monitors the position of the side stand. If it's in the down position while the vehicle is in motion, the microprocessor sends a signal to retract it.
4. **Static Motion Detection**: If the vehicle is in motion but not moving at a significant speed (static motion), and the side stand is still down, the microprocessor also sends a signal to change its position.

This system effectively ensures that the side stand is retracted when it's unsafe for it to be down, such as when the vehicle is in motion, while still allowing it to be deployed when the vehicle is stationary and parked. 

# Advantages
Sure, here are some potential uses and benefits of an automatic side stand retrieving system:

1. **Safety Improvement**: One of the primary benefits is increased safety for riders. Forgetting to retract the side stand before riding can lead to accidents, especially during turns or at high speeds. An automatic system ensures that the side stand is always in the correct position when the vehicle is in motion, reducing the risk of accidents caused by side stand deployment.

2. **Convenience**: Riders don't have to remember to manually retract the side stand before riding. This convenience can be particularly useful in situations where riders might be distracted or in a rush.

3. **Prevention of Damage**: Retracting the side stand automatically helps prevent damage to the stand itself, as well as to the road surface or other objects that the stand might scrape against if left down while riding.

4. **Extended Lifespan**: By preventing unnecessary wear and tear on the side stand mechanism, an automatic system can contribute to the overall longevity of the motorcycle or bicycle.

5. **Customization**: Depending on the design, the system could potentially be customized to include additional features, such as adjustable speed thresholds for side stand retraction, or integration with other safety systems on the vehicle.

6. **Market Appeal**: Motorcycles or bicycles equipped with advanced safety features like an automatic side stand retrieving system may have increased market appeal to safety-conscious consumers.

Overall, implementing such a system can enhance both the safety and convenience of riding motorcycles or bicycles, potentially leading to a smoother and more enjoyable experience for riders.
